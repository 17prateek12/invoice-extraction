# invoice-extraction

The project's aim was to fetch data from scanned invoices. The project was done with the help of Pytesseract to extract the data from images, and then NLP data processing steps were carried out to clean and process that data. With the help of regular expressions and NER, I have tried to extract the data as much as possible.
In the data, there are both structured and unstructured templates. My research and testing revealed that we can easily filter data using a structured template as compared to an unstructured one. But still, accuracy is not 100 percent. There is still a need to find a better approach to it. We can use masked CNN, which involves the tracking of CNN, to find out the position of information and especially extract information that has a borderless table or is certainly paragraphy. For example, in some invoices, information was given like the inovice number in key: pair form invoice no.: xyz124,"Â  which is easy to extract and process since pytesseract or any other OC library like EasyOCR were extracting information line by line from left to right. but in certain templates, "invoice no" and "xyz1234" numbers were not given in key:pair form invoice was written and its number just below it, which makes it difficult to extract them since both are in separate lines.
